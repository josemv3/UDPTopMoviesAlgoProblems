# UDPTopMoviesAlgoProblems
Mentor lead algorithm questions and solutions with a custom data model, and a swift package manager. 

5 algorithm questions solved using the command line tool in Xcode,
command line was used in order to use a Swift Package Manager CSV reader (initial data). 

I have built the dictionaries in a couple of different ways to solve each question efficiently. 
Some questions are solved in 0(1) constant time, and others utilize for loops O(n) Linear. 

For question 1 solve, please uncomment line 105 to call getDreamworksMovies().
For question 2 solve, please uncomment line 140 to call getTopMovieByDistrubutor().
For question 3 solve, please uncomment line 179 to call distributorWithMostFilmsOnList().
For question 4 solve, please uncomment line 207 to call getFirstYearTopMovies().
For question 5 solve, please uncomment line 235 to call getRatingsDistribution().
